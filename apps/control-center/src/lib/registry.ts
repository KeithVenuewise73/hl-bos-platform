/**
 * The Herman Legacy software portfolio.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY HONEST. Most of these products do not exist yet, and this file
 * says so rather than rendering an invented health bar next to a name.
 *
 * HL-BOS principle 10: "Never invent successful runs, messages, payments, AI
 * results, customer interactions, or operational metrics." A pipeline view that
 * shows SalonAI as "healthy" when SalonAI has no code would break that on the
 * CEO's home screen -- the worst possible place for the platform to lie.
 *
 * A product moves off `not-started` when it has code in this repository.
