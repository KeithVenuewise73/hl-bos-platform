/**
 * The Herman Legacy software portfolio.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY HONEST. Most of these products do not exist yet, and this file
 * says so rather than rendering an invented health bar next to a name.
 *
 * HL-BOS principle 10: "Never invent successful runs, messages, payments, AI
 * results, customer interactions, or operational metrics." A pipeline view that
 * shows SalonAI as "healthy" when SalonAI has no code would break that on the
 * CEO's home screen -- the worst possible place for the platform to lie.
 *
 * A product moves off `not-started` when it has code in this repository.

CORRECTION (2026-09-17): this panel said migration 0048 was UNAPPLIED. It is not — the `ats` schema has existed in the canonical project since 2026-09-16, applied out of band at a version the repository does not carry. The app itself is unchanged and still writes to a local JSON file, and its Settings page still tells a user that, so the schema is applied but unused.

Migration 0049 is APPLIED to the canonical project (2026-09-17, under your approval) and was verified there, not just locally: 11 structural checks, 5 fail-closed isolation checks and 8 end-to-end checks with a real account, which the database then deleted along with every row it owned. Native iOS and Android projects exist and carry the app's own icons and version. TWO THINGS ARE STILL NOT TRUE: no build has been pointed at the database yet, so the app runs device-only and says so on its Account screen and the app-to-database hop has never run; and neither store has been submitted to — no iOS archive (needs Xcode on a Mac), no Android bundle (needs the SDK), no signing identities and no store records.",
